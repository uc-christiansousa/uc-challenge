# UC Challenge

You don't need to modify the `index.html` page, changing the `script.js` will be enough to complete the challenge

## Rules

- Implement the **Unblock All** function that will execute the scripts in the page (excluding `./script.js`)
- Implement the **Block All** function that prevents/stops the scripts from running (exluding `./script.js`)
- Have fun ðŸ’ª
